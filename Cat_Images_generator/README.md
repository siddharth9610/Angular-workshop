## How to install

Run `ng version` and `npm -v` to see your versions of Angular and Node. 
You need versions:
Angular CLI: 16.1.0
Node: 18.16.0

To switch in right node version, I recommend to download Node Version Manager.
Steps to change Node version by Node Version Manager:
1. Open Terminal as administrator.
2. To install Node version 18.16.0 run `nvm install 18.16.0`.
3. To see all available Node versions run `nvm list`.
4. To set needed Node version run `nvm use 18.16.0`.

In other case, you need to uninstall your Node and install Node 18.16.0.

To install Angular run `npm install -g @angular/cli@16.1.0`
If you have other installed Angular version you need to unistall it:
1. To uninstall Angular run `npm unistall -g @angular/cli`.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force`.
3. To install needed Angular version run `npm install -g @angular/cli@16.1.0`.

## Hosting

To deploy project:
1. Run `ng build`.
2. Run `firebase deploy`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
